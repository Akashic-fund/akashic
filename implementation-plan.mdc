# Implementation Plan

This file tracks the sequential implementation of features and tasks in the Akashic project using markdown-plan syntax.

## Current Sprint

### Setup and Infrastructure Tasks

1. [x] Create implementation tracking system
   - [x] Set up implementation-plan.mdc file
   - [x] Create agent work tracking rules
   - [x] Establish workflow for progress updates

2. [ ] Agent-Generated Work Tracking
   - [x] Define rules for AI assistant contributions
   - [ ] Set up tracking for automated changes
   - [ ] Create documentation standards for agent work

### Donation Form Optimization

3. [ ] Improve Donation Form Performance and UX
   - [ ] Implement code splitting for Stripe Elements to reduce initial bundle size
   - [ ] Add loading states and skeleton components during Stripe initialization
   - [ ] Optimize form validation with debounced input handling
   - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for payment failures
   - [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness and touch targets

4. [ ] Enhance Donation Form UI/UX
   - [ ] Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
   - [ ] Implement donation amount validation with helpful messaging
   - [ ] Add currency formatting and localization support

### Payment System Integration

5. [ ] Implement Stripe Webhook Handler
   - [ ] Analyze `/api/crowdsplit/webhook/` and `/api/webhooks/crowdsplit` and consolidate between both keeping only `/api/crowdsplit/webhook/`. Make sure existing functionality does not break
   - [ ] Create `/api/crowdsplit/webhook/stripe` endpoint for payment confirmations
   - [ ] Implement webhook signature verification for security. Create a temporary direct secret comparison method, and an additional header signature hmac sha256 method (which is not enforced if no signatures are in the header)
   - [ ] Handle `transaction.updated` events to update payment status
   - [ ] Add webhook event logging and monitoring
   - [ ] Test webhook reliability with ngrok during development

6. [ ] Fix Payment Database Persistence
   - [ ] Ensure payment records are created when Crowdsplit payment is initiated
   - [ ] Store `payment_intent_id` as `externalId` in Payment table
   - [ ] Implement proper user-payment association during payment creation
   - [ ] Add campaign-payment relationship during payment initialization
   - [ ] Handle payment status updates from webhook events
   - [ ] Add proper error handling for failed payment saves

### Payment Visibility and UI

7. [ ] Enhance Payment Display in UI
   - [ ] Fix payment list loading to show recent confirmed donations
   - [ ] Add real-time payment status updates in campaign transaction tabs
   - [ ] Implement donation success page with proper payment confirmation
   - [ ] Add payment status badges (pending, confirmed, failed)
   - [ ] Show payment method information (card vs wallet) in transaction history

8. [ ] Implement Payment Dashboard
   - [ ] Create donor dashboard showing personal donation history
   - [ ] Add payment filtering and search functionality
   - [ ] Implement donation analytics and reporting
   - [ ] Add campaign-specific donation tracking
   - [ ] Show payment method usage statistics
   - [ ] Add export functionality for donation records

### Testing and Quality Assurance

9. [ ] Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for payment flows
   - [ ] Add integration tests for webhook processing
   - [ ] Test payment failure scenarios and recovery
   - [ ] Validate payment data integrity across systems
   - [ ] Performance testing for donation form load times
   - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing for payment forms

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup
1. [x] Create implementation tracking system - Done 2025-01-21
   - Set up implementation-plan.mdc file using markdown-plan syntax
   - Created agent-tracking-rules.mdc with comprehensive guidelines for AI assistant work

## Task Dependencies

Tasks should be completed in the order listed above. Critical dependencies:
- Task 5 (Stripe Webhook Handler) must be completed before Task 6 (Payment Database Persistence)
- Task 6 must be completed before Task 7 (Payment Display UI)
- Tasks 3-4 (Donation Form Optimization) can be worked on in parallel with payment system tasks

## Progress Notes

### Implementation Tracking System Setup - 2025-01-21
**Status**: Done
**Summary**: Created implementation-plan.mdc file using markdown-plan syntax and established agent-tracking-rules.mdc with comprehensive guidelines for AI assistant work tracking and documentation standards.
