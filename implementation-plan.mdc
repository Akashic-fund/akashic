## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup
1. [x] Create implementation tracking system - Done 2025-01-21
   - Set up implementation-plan.mdc file using markdown-plan syntax
   - Created agent-tracking-rules.mdc with comprehensive guidelines for AI assistant work

### Donation Form Performance Optimization - 2025-01-21
**Status**: In Progress
**Summary**: Implemented code splitting for Stripe Elements, created lazy-loaded components with error boundaries, added debounced validation hooks, progress indicators, and enhanced UX with suggested amounts and real-time validation feedback.

### Refactor Donation Form Component Architecture - [Current Date]
**Status**: Done
**Summary**: Successfully broke down 485-line monolithic component into 6 focused components (each <80 LOC) and custom hook for business logic.
Created maintainable, testable, and reusable components following single responsibility principle with proper separation of concerns.

### Connect Refactored Form and Clean Up - [Current Date]
**Status**: Done
**Summary**: Connected new refactored donation form to app/campaigns/[slug]/donation/page.tsx and removed old unused files.
Cleaned up codebase by deleting donation-form.tsx and donation-form-optimized.tsx, eliminating file clutter.

### Fix Payment Flow Performance Issues - 2025-01-21
**Status**: Done  
**Summary**: Completely resolved the 20+ second performance issue by implementing lazy payment intent creation. Enhanced error handling with detailed authentication messages, added proper wallet connection prompts, and ensured both crypto and Stripe payments work correctly with anonymous donation support. All components follow maintainability guidelines.

### Implement Payment Database Persistence - 2025-01-21
**Status**: Done  
**Summary**: Successfully implemented payment database persistence with unified CrowdSplit webhook handler. CrowdSplit wraps both Stripe (credit cards) and Bridge.xyz (crypto/stablecoins), so all webhooks come through the single CrowdSplit endpoint. Updated payment creation to save records with proper provider ('CROWDSPLIT'), token types (USD for cards, USDC/CELO for crypto), and metadata to distinguish underlying payment methods.

### Enhance CrowdSplit Webhook and Payment Authentication - [Current Date]
**Status**: Done
**Summary**: Enhanced webhook authentication with multi-method support including payload secrets, HMAC SHA256, and Stripe-style signatures. Created shared authentication utility to reduce code duplication. Improved payment route validation with proper error handling patterns, request validation, and comprehensive debug logging. All endpoints now follow consistent API patterns with timing-attack protection.

### Implement Unified CrowdSplit Webhook Handler - [Current Date]
**Status**: Done
**Summary**: Created single webhook endpoint that handles all CrowdSplit event types. Implemented internal event routing based on event type (transaction.updated, kyc.status_updated). Consolidated payment and KYC webhook logic into unified handler. Removed separate /payments and /kyc webhook endpoints (early development - no deprecation needed). Added comprehensive event type detection and validation. Maintained all existing authentication and security features. Updated webhook documentation to reflect unified approach. Tested unified endpoint with proper event routing functionality.

## Task Dependencies

Tasks should be completed in the order listed above. Critical dependencies:
- Task 5 (Stripe Webhook Handler) must be completed before Task 6 (Payment Database Persistence)
- Task 6 must be completed before Task 7 (Payment Display UI)
- Tasks 3-4 (Donation Form Optimization) can be worked on in parallel with payment system tasks
